# What is T-root?

T-root is a tool that uses proroot to simulate root privileges, using the word root as a shortcut to activate it.

# INSTALLATION:

* ` apt update && apt -y upgrade` 
* ` pkg install -y git `
* ` pkg install -y proot `
* ` termux-setup-storage `
* ` rm -rf T-ROOT `
* ` git clone https://github.com/U7P4L-IN/T-ROOT `
* ` cd T-ROOT`
* ` bash install.sh `
* ` ./start `

To activate the privileges, just text the word root and when PS1($) shows # the service will already be activated. To deactivate it, just text exit to exit it
