# What is T-root?

T-root is a tool that uses proroot to simulate root privileges, using the word root as a shortcut to activate it.

# INSTALLATION:




To activate the privileges, just text the word root and when PS1($) shows # the service will already be activated. To deactivate it, just text exit to exit it
